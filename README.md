Github Repo README
======

This is the design starterkit used by Jen Simmons. It's made out of pieces from lots of different places, including HTML5 Boilerplate. I heavily use Sass, so my current Sass file organization best-practices are in here. I use Codekit to compiles my Sass, and Codekit also has a tool for compiling HTML files out of .kit files. It's very handy. I edit and create .kit files, and the HTML is generated by robots. That way I can change things like the HTML head or the navigation just once, and have it altered in all the html files. If you want to use the .kit files, go download Codekit. http://incident57.com/codekit/

If you like this, feel free to use it. I'd love to hear what you think. File an issue on Github. 

If you don't like it, then don't use it. No need to waste your time or mine telling me that you hate it. Sure, there are other/better ways to do everything. Go for it. No need to involve me.

Also, this might be full of crazy scratch code, mistakes, leftover stuff that wouldn't be there if I had seen it... so use at your own risk, and use your own brain. Not everything in here is great. If you see something you don't understand, do a Google search on that line of code and you'll likely figure it out. That's how I learned what a lot of this code does.

Meanwhile, this will keep evolving. It might suddenly and radically change without warning. I make no promises. It's really just for me. I just thought I'd make this repo public in case it's helpful or interesting to anyone.
